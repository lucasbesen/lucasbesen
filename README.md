## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer that loves to work with great and complex things. I have passion for solving problems, delivering great user experiences and making ideas come to life.

I've worked mostly in a full-stack approach and I learned strong concepts about backend, frontend web and mobile. Nowadays I've been focusing on frontend development specially in mobile applications.

Some hard skills I've been practicing and I have experience to help anyone:

- JavaScript
- React and React Native
- Frontend architectures using either state management tools like Redux/Mobx or GraphQL clients like Relay/Apollo
- Backend development using Node.js with emphasis on GraphQL APIs

I'm passionate about self-improvement. Some soft skills I have:

- Very communicative
- Friendly and helpful
- Really like to help the dev community
